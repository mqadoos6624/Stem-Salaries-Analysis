# Stem-Salaries-Analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyze the STEM salries trend in IT industry. I make use of the public data avaialble on Kaggle.

***Setup:     
           **First imported and loaded the data.
           **Then we have performed the initital preprocessing and clean the data by removing the outliers and removed NULL values.
           **I have analayze the trend between base-salary and "Education, Gender, State, Companies" and other attributes.
                *1. Analyzed the trend between base-salary and Education to compare base-salary based on level of Education.
                *2. Analyzed he trend between base-salary and Gender to compare base-salary among genders and compare which gender is taking more salaries.
                *3. Analyzed he trend between base-salary and State to check which states are giving more salaries based on education, gender and company.
          
***Analysis:  
            **After Analzing the data we came up with the following conclusions:
                 *1. Overall, in gender *Males* are making more salary than females.
                 *2. In some states females are getting more bonus than male.
                 *3. According to analysis *California* is the top state based on salary because all top companies headquarter are there.
                 *4. Also according to the trend candidates who have *PhD* degree are making more money than other level of education.
                 
***Machine Learning Algorithm (Classification Algorithm):
                 *1. Data is standardized in order to reduced *bias* and *variance* to avioud problem of fitting (either underfitting or overfitting).
                 *2. Required attributes are converted to desire form for alogorithm to support using Label-Encoding.
             Support Vector Machine (SVM):
                 *1. I have Implemented Support Vector MAchines (SVM) algorithm to an compare the level of education with the original level.
                 *2. The accuracy I got from this Algorithm is 95% because of large amount of data was missing.
             Regression Analysis:
                 *1. I have estimated the base-salary using the desire attributes and got accuracy of 85%.
             
             
                                                                          ****** End ******
